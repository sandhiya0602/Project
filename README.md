# ☕ Coffee Shop Sales Analysis | Power BI Dashboard

## Built with Passion

I love coffee. One day while sipping my favorite brew, I thought, "Why not build a Power BI project around something I truly enjoy?"  
That moment sparked this project - a complete sales analysis report for a coffee shop, built out of curiosity and love for data.
